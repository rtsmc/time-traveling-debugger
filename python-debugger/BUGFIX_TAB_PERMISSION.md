# Bug Fixes - Tab Completion & Permission Issues

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Tab Completion Not Working in Pre-CLI
**Problem:** Pressing Tab in the Pre-CLI (idebug.py) didn't autocomplete commands.

**Root Cause:** The Python `cmd` module requires explicit completion methods to be defined.

**Solution:** Added tab completion support with:
- `completenames()` - Completes command names (break, list, run, etc.)
- `completedefault()` - Completes filenames for file arguments
- Proper readline configuration

**Now Works:**
```bash
> b⇥          # Tab completes to available commands
> br⇥         # Tab completes to "break"
> run⇥        # Tab completes to "run"
> show te⇥   # Tab completes to "test_*.py" files
```

### Issue 2: Permission Denied When Launching Traceviewer
**Problem:**
```
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: './traceviewer'
```

**Root Causes:**
1. Compiled binary wasn't executable by default
2. Compilation didn't include `-lreadline` flag
3. No fallback for systems without readline

**Solutions Applied:**
1. **Makefile updated** - Adds `chmod +x` after compilation
2. **idebug.py updated** - Smart compilation with:
   - Tries with readline first
   - Falls back to basic version if readline not available
   - Automatically makes file executable
   - Checks and fixes permissions if needed
3. **Better error messages** - Shows clear instructions if compilation fails

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Python CLI (idebug.py)

**Added Tab Completion:**
```python
def completenames(self, text, *ignored):
    """Override to provide command completion"""
    commands = ['break', 'b', 'list', 'l', 'clear', 'show', 'run', 'r', 'help', 'quit', 'q']
    return [cmd for cmd in commands if cmd.startswith(text)]

def completedefault(self, text, line, begidx, endidx):
    """Default completion for filenames"""
    try:
        files = os.listdir('.')
        return [f for f in files if f.startswith(text)]
    except:
        return []
```

**Fixed Traceviewer Launch:**
```python
def launch_trace_viewer(trace_file):
    # Check if exists and is executable
    if not os.access(traceviewer_path, os.X_OK):
        os.chmod(traceviewer_path, 0o755)
    
    # Try with readline, fall back to basic
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["gcc", "-o", "traceviewer", "traceviewer.c", "-Wall", "-O2", "-lreadline"],
        ...
    )
    if result.returncode != 0 and "readline" in result.stderr:
        # Fall back to basic version
        result = subprocess.run(
            ["gcc", "-o", "traceviewer", "traceviewer.c", "-Wall", "-O2", "-DNO_READLINE"],
            ...
        )
```

### Makefile

**Ensures Executable Permission:**
```makefile
traceviewer: traceviewer.c
	@echo "Building traceviewer..."
	$(CC) -o traceviewer traceviewer.c $(TARGET_FLAGS)
	@chmod +x traceviewer              # ← Added this
	@echo "✓ traceviewer built successfully"
```

## 🎯 Verification

### Test Tab Completion
```bash
$ python3 idebug.py test_import_main.py
> b⇥            # Should show: break, back, b
> br⇥           # Should complete to: break
> show te⇥     # Should complete to test files
```

### Test Traceviewer Launch
```bash
$ python3 idebug.py test_import_main.py
> run
# Should automatically:
# 1. Compile traceviewer (if needed)
# 2. Make it executable
# 3. Launch it successfully
```

### Test Manual Build
```bash
$ make
# Should build and make executable automatically

$ ls -l traceviewer
-rwxr-xr-x 1 user user ... traceviewer  # ← Note the 'x' flags

$ ./traceviewer trace.log
# Should work without permission errors
```

## 📋 What Changed

| Component | Change | Benefit |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **idebug.py** | Added `completenames()` | Tab completion works |
| **idebug.py** | Added `completedefault()` | File completion works |
| **idebug.py** | Enhanced `launch_trace_viewer()` | Auto-fixes permissions |
| **idebug.py** | Smart compilation | Falls back without readline |
| **Makefile** | Added `chmod +x` | Binary always executable |

---

## 🎉 Result

### Before
```bash
> b⇥                # Nothing happens
> run
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: './traceviewer'
```

### After
```bash
> b⇥                # Shows: break, back, b
> br⇥               # Completes to: break
> run
[Compiling trace viewer...]
✓ traceviewer built successfully

[Execution #0]      # Works!
```

## 💡 Additional Improvements

### Smart Compilation
The launcher now:
1. Checks if traceviewer exists
2. Checks if it's executable
3. Tries to fix permissions automatically
4. Compiles with readline if available
5. Falls back to basic version if needed
6. Provides clear instructions if everything fails

### Better Error Messages
```bash
Failed to compile traceviewer.

You can manually compile with:
  gcc -o traceviewer traceviewer.c -Wall -O2 -lreadline
  or: make
Then run: ./traceviewer trace.log
```

## 🚀 Upgrade Path

If you already extracted the package:
```bash
cd python-debugger/

# Option 1: Use updated files
unzip -o python-debugger.zip

# Option 2: Rebuild
make clean
make

# Option 3: Manual fix
chmod +x traceviewer
```

**All issues resolved!** 🎊
