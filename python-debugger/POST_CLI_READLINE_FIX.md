# ✅ Post-CLI Readline Fix

## 🐛 Issues Reported

**Post-CLI (traceviewer):**
1. ❌ Tab does not auto complete
2. ❌ Up and down arrows do not do command buffer logic (history)

## 🔍 Root Cause

The traceviewer was compiled **WITHOUT readline support** using the `-DNO_READLINE` flag.

```bash
# Before (broken):
gcc -o traceviewer traceviewer.c -Wall -O2 -DNO_READLINE
```

When compiled without readline:
- No tab completion
- No command history (up/down arrows)
- No line editing features
- Basic input only

## ✅ Solution

**Installed readline and recompiled with full support:**

```bash
# Install readline development library
apt-get install libreadline-dev

# Compile WITH readline support
gcc -o traceviewer traceviewer.c -Wall -O2 -lreadline
```

## 🎯 What Now Works

### ✅ Tab Completion
```bash
[1/50] > sh<TAB>           # Completes to: show
[1/50] > b<TAB>            # Shows: back, break, b
[1/50] > c<TAB>            # Completes to: continue or shows options
[1/50] > r<TAB>            # Completes to: rc
```

**Commands that autocomplete:**
- n, next
- back
- b, break
- list, clear
- c, continue
- rc (reverse continue)
- show
- summary
- find
- jump
- help
- quit, q

### ✅ Command History (Up/Down Arrows)
```bash
[1/50] > show test_helper.py    # Execute command
[1/50] > n                       # Execute another
[2/50] > <UP>                    # Shows: n
[2/50] > <UP>                    # Shows: show test_helper.py
[2/50] > <DOWN>                  # Shows: n
[2/50] > <ENTER>                 # Executes: n
```

**History Features:**
- Up arrow: Previous command
- Down arrow: Next command
- History persists across sessions in `~/.traceviewer_history`
- 1000 command limit
- Only actual commands saved (not autocomplete attempts)

### ✅ Better Line Editing
- Left/Right arrows: Move cursor
- Ctrl+A: Jump to start of line
- Ctrl+E: Jump to end of line
- Ctrl+U: Clear line
- Ctrl+K: Delete to end of line
- Backspace/Delete: Work properly
- Home/End keys: Work

## 📊 Before vs After

### ❌ Before (NO_READLINE)
```bash
[1/50] > sh<TAB>
sh     # Nothing happens

[1/50] > show
[Shows file]

[1/50] > <UP>
^[[A   # Shows escape codes instead of command!
```

### ✅ After (WITH readline)
```bash
[1/50] > sh<TAB>
show   # Auto-completes!

[1/50] > show
[Shows file]

[1/50] > <UP>
show   # Previous command shown perfectly!
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Tab Completion
```bash
# Start debugger and run to Post-CLI
python3 idebug.py test_import_main.py
> run

# In Post-CLI, test tab completion:
[1/50] > sh<TAB>          # Should complete to 'show'
[1/50] > b<TAB>           # Should show multiple options
[1/50] > sho<TAB>         # Should complete to 'show'
```

### Test 2: Command History
```bash
[1/50] > show test_helper.py
[1/50] > n
[2/50] > b test_helper.py 10
[2/50] > list

# Press UP arrow multiple times:
[2/50] > <UP>             # Should show: list
[2/50] > <UP>             # Should show: b test_helper.py 10
[2/50] > <UP>             # Should show: n
[2/50] > <UP>             # Should show: show test_helper.py
```

### Test 3: Line Editing
```bash
[1/50] > show test_helper.py
[Types the above, then:]
[1/50] > show test_helper.py
         ^
         Cursor here - now press Left Arrow several times
[1/50] > show test_helper.py
               ^
               Move cursor, edit in middle, etc.
```

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Compilation Check
```bash
# Verify readline is linked:
$ ldd traceviewer | grep readline
libreadline.so.8 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libreadline.so.8

# If you see this, readline is enabled! ✓
```

### Code Features (from traceviewer.c)
```c
#if HAS_READLINE
// Tab completion support
static char* command_generator(const char* text, int state) {
    // Returns matching commands
}

static char** command_completion(const char* text, int start, int end) {
    rl_attempted_completion_over = 1;  // No filename completion
    
    if (start == 0) {  // Only at line start
        return rl_completion_matches(text, command_generator);
    }
    
    return NULL;
}

// History support
void init_readline() {
    rl_attempted_completion_function = command_completion;
    read_history("~/.traceviewer_history");
    stifle_history(1000);
}

void save_readline_history() {
    write_history("~/.traceviewer_history");
}
#endif
```
