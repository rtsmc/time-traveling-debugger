# CLI Enhancement Features - Command History & Line Editing

## ✨ New Professional CLI Features

Your debugger now has production-grade command line features!

### 1. ⬆️⬇️ **Command History** (Up/Down Arrow Keys)
Navigate through previously entered commands using arrow keys.

**Usage:**
```bash
[1/50] > b test.py 14          # Type a command
[1/50] > show                  # Type another command
[1/50] > ↑                     # Press Up - shows "show"
[1/50] > ↑                     # Press Up again - shows "b test.py 14"
[1/50] > ↓                     # Press Down - back to "show"
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Saves last 1000 commands
- ✅ Persistent across sessions
- ✅ Separate history files:
  - Pre-CLI: `~/.idebug_history`
  - Post-CLI: `~/.traceviewer_history`

---

### 2. ⬅️➡️ **Cursor Movement** (Left/Right Arrow Keys)
Edit commands by moving cursor left and right.

**Usage:**
```bash
[1/50] > b test.py 144         # Oops, typo!
[1/50] > b test.py 14|4        # Press ← to move cursor
[1/50] > b test.py 1|44        # Press ← again
[1/50] > b test.py 1|4         # Press Backspace to delete
[1/50] > b test.py 14          # Fixed! Press Enter
```

**Editing Keys:**
- `←` / `→` - Move cursor left/right
- `Home` - Jump to start of line
- `End` - Jump to end of line
- `Ctrl+A` - Jump to start (alternative)
- `Ctrl+E` - Jump to end (alternative)
- `Ctrl+U` - Clear entire line
- `Ctrl+K` - Delete from cursor to end
- `Backspace` - Delete character before cursor
- `Delete` - Delete character at cursor

---

### 3. ⏎ **Enter Aliasing** (Repeat Last Command)
Press Enter on empty line to repeat the last command.

**Usage:**
```bash
[1/50] > n                     # Next step
[2/50] > ⏎                     # Press Enter (empty) - runs "n" again
[3/50] > ⏎                     # Press Enter again - runs "n" again
[4/50] > ⏎                     # Keep pressing Enter to step through
[5/50] > show                  # Run different command
[5/50] > ⏎                     # Press Enter - runs "show" again
```

**Perfect for:**
- Stepping through execution (`n` then Enter, Enter, Enter...)
- Repeating searches
- Re-running any command quickly

---

### 4. ⇥ **Tab Completion** (Auto-complete Commands)
Start typing a command and press Tab to complete it.

**Usage:**
```bash
[1/50] > h⇥                    # Press Tab after 'h'
[1/50] > help                  # Auto-completes to "help"

[1/50] > ba⇥                   # Press Tab after 'ba'
[1/50] > back                  # Auto-completes to "back"

[1/50] > c⇥                    # Press Tab after 'c'
c       clear   continue       # Shows all commands starting with 'c'
```

**Available Commands for Tab Completion:**
```
n           - Next step
next        - Next step (alias)
back        - Previous step
b           - Set breakpoint (short)
break       - Set breakpoint
list        - List breakpoints
clear       - Clear breakpoints
c           - Continue (short)

## 🎬 Complete Workflow Example

### Efficient Debugging Session

```bash
$ ./traceviewer trace.log

[1/50] > b te⇥                      # Tab completes nothing (no match)
[1/50] > b test_import_main.py 14   # Set breakpoint
✓ Breakpoint set

[1/50] > li⇥                        # Tab completes to "list"
[1/50] > list
1. test_import_main.py:14

[1/50] > c                          # Continue to breakpoint
⚫ BREAKPOINT HIT
[13/50] > show                      # Show source
[Shows file with breakpoint markers]

[13/50] > n                         # Next step
[14/50] > ⏎                         # Press Enter - repeats "n"
[15/50] > ⏎                         # Press Enter - repeats "n"
[16/50] > ⏎                         # Press Enter - repeats "n"

[17/50] > ⏎                         # Press Enter - runs "show"
[Shows source file]

[17/50] > su⇥                       # Tab completes to "summary"
[17/50] > summary
[Shows trace summary]

[17/50] > q                         # Quit
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. **Quick Stepping**
```bash
[1/50] > n     # Type once
