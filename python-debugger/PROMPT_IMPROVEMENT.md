# Prompt Display Improvement - Oct 30, 2025

## ✨ What Changed

### Simplified Prompt Format

**Before:**
```
[Exec #12 - 13/50] > :13
```

**After:**
```
[13/50] > :13
```

---

## 🎯 Why This is Better

### 1. **Cleaner Display**
- Removed redundant "Exec #12" prefix
- Shows only the user-friendly position: `[13/50]`
- Less visual clutter

### 2. **Perfect Alignment**
- What you **see**: `[13/50]`
- What you **type**: `:13`
- Direct 1:1 correspondence ✅

### 3. **Intuitive**
- No internal execution order number exposed
- Just your current position out of total
- Simple and clear

---

## 📋 Complete Example

```bash
./traceviewer trace.log

# Start at position 1
[1/50] > 

# Jump to position 5
[1/50] > :5
[5/50] >

# Jump to position 13 (breakpoint line)
[5/50] > :13
[13/50] >

# Jump to last position
[13/50] > :50
[50/50] >

# Jump back to first
[50/50] > :1
[1/50] >
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### What Was Removed
- Internal execution order number (`Exec #X`)
- This was 0-based and confusing
- Only needed internally for trace matching

### What Remains
- User-friendly 1-based position (`[Y/Z]`)
- `Y` = current position (1 to N)
- `Z` = total executions
- Clean and simple!

## ⚡ Combined with Previous Fixes

### Complete Fix History:

1. **✅ Jump Indexing** (Earlier today)
   - Changed from 0-based to 1-based
   - Type `:13` instead of `:12`

2. **✅ Prompt Simplification** (Just now)
   - Changed from `[Exec #12 - 13/50]` to `[13/50]`
   - Perfect alignment with user input

3. **✅ Breakpoint Line Fix** (Earlier)
   - Identified line 13 is a comment
   - Use line 14 for breakpoint instead

## 🎨 Visual Comparison

### Before All Fixes
```
[Exec #12 - 13/50] > :12      ← Confusing! Had to use :12 not :13
⚫ BREAKPOINT HIT
```

### After All Fixes
```
[13/50] > :13                  ← Clear! Type what you see!
⚫ BREAKPOINT HIT
```

## 💡 User Experience Improvement

**Mental model now:**
- "I'm at position 13 out of 50"
- "I want to go to position 5"
- "I type `:5`"
- "I'm now at `[5/50]`"

**Perfect 1:1 correspondence between display and input!**

## ✨ Summary

This change makes the debugger more intuitive by:
- ✅ Removing internal implementation details
- ✅ Showing only what users need to know
- ✅ Perfect alignment between prompt and commands
- ✅ Cleaner, simpler interface

Happy debugging! 🐛
