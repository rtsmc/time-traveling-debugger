## **PRE-CLI FIXES (idebug.py)**

### ✅ Fix #1: Autocomplete Limited to .py Files
**Issue:** Tab autocomplete showed ALL files, not just Python files.

**What Changed:**
- Modified `completedefault()` method to filter for `.py` files only
- Autocomplete now only works for `break`, `b`, and `show` commands
- Other commands don't trigger filename completion

**Before:**
```bash
> show te<TAB>
test_helper.py  test_import_main.py  test.txt  temp.log
```

**After:**
```bash
> show te<TAB>
test_helper.py  test_import_main.py  # Only .py files!
```

---

### ✅ Fix #2: History Only Tracks Executed Commands
**Issue:** Up/down arrow history included tab-completion attempts and partial commands.

**What Changed:**
- Disabled readline's automatic history with `readline.set_auto_history(False)`
- Manually add only executed commands via `readline.add_history()` in `precmd()`
- Tab-completion attempts are no longer saved to history

**Before:**
```bash
History contains:
  show t<TAB>
  show te<TAB>
  show test_h<TAB>
  show test_helper.py
```

**After:**
```bash
History contains:
  show test_helper.py  # Only actual commands!
```

## **POST-CLI FIXES (traceviewer.c)**

### ✅ Fix #3: Show Command Accepts Filename Parameter
**Issue:** `show` command could only display the current file, not imported files.

**What Changed:**
- Updated `show_file()` function signature to accept optional filename: `show_file(viewer, filename)`
- Command handler now parses filename argument: `show [filename]`
- If no filename given, shows current file (default behavior preserved)
- If filename given, shows that file with breakpoints marked
- Current line is only highlighted if viewing the current execution file

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
[5/50] > show                    # Shows current file
[5/50] > show test_helper.py     # Shows imported file
[5/50] > show test_import_main.py # Shows main file
```

**Features:**
- ⚫ Red dots mark breakpoints in any file
- 🟢 Green highlight shows current line (only in current file)
- Works with both absolute and relative paths
- Supports basename matching (e.g., `show test.py` matches `/path/to/test.py`)

### ℹ️ Already Working: Break in Imported Files
**Status:** ✅ Already implemented!

**How to Use:**
```bash
[5/50] > b test_helper.py 10     # Set breakpoint in imported file
✓ Breakpoint set at test_helper.py:10

[5/50] > c                        # Continue to breakpoint
[Stops at test_helper.py:10]
```

The `b <file> <line>` command was already working for imported files! The intelligent path matching in `filenames_match()` handles:
- Exact matches
- Substring matches
- Basename matches

---

### ℹ️ Already Working: Tab Autocomplete Commands Only
**Status:** ✅ Already implemented correctly!

**How it Works:**
```c
static char** command_completion(const char* text, int start, int end) {
    rl_attempted_completion_over = 1;  // Prevents filename completion
    
    if (start == 0) {  // Only at line start
        return rl_completion_matches(text, command_generator);
    }
    
    return NULL;  // No completion for arguments
}
```

**Behavior:**
```bash
[5/50] > sh<TAB>      # Completes to: show
[5/50] > b<TAB>       # Completes to: back, break, b
[5/50] > show te<TAB> # Does NOT autocomplete filename (correct!)
```

## 📋 Complete Feature List

### **Pre-Execution CLI (idebug.py)**
✅ Set breakpoints before execution  
✅ Autocomplete commands  
✅ Autocomplete .py filenames for `break`/`show`  
✅ View source files with line numbers  
✅ List/clear breakpoints  
✅ Clean command history (no tab attempts)  
✅ Up/down arrow navigation  

### **Post-Execution CLI (traceviewer)**
✅ Navigate execution trace (next/back)  
✅ Jump to specific execution: `:5` goes to `[5/50]`  
✅ Set breakpoints during trace analysis  
✅ Continue to next/previous breakpoint  
✅ Show ANY file with `show [filename]`  
✅ Breakpoints work in imported files  
✅ Tab completion for commands only  
✅ Search for variables  
✅ Summary statistics

## 🧪 Testing the Fixes

### Test Pre-CLI Fixes:
```bash
python3 idebug.py test_import_main.py

# Test autocomplete (only .py files):
> show te<TAB>        # Should show only .py files

# Test history (only executed commands):
> show test_helper.py
> list
> <UP>                # Should show 'list', not partial commands
```

### Test Post-CLI Fixes:
```bash
# After running and getting to post-CLI:
[1/50] > show                    # Shows current file
[1/50] > show test_helper.py     # Shows imported file (NEW!)
[1/50] > b test_helper.py 5      # Set breakpoint in imported file
[1/50] > c                        # Continue to breakpoint
```

## 📦 Files Modified

1. **idebug.py** - Pre-execution CLI
   - Fixed `completedefault()` to filter .py files
   - Added `readline.set_auto_history(False)`
   - Modified `precmd()` to manually add history

2. **traceviewer.c** - Post-execution CLI
   - Updated `show_file()` to accept filename parameter
   - Modified command handler for `show [filename]`
   - Updated help text

3. **No changes needed** - These already worked:
   - `b <file> <line>` for imported files
   - Tab completion (commands only)
